## What's wrong with concat?

* **One gigant bundle** is *bad*
  * because many unneccessary bytes are transferred
* **Loading every module separate** is also *bad*
  * because too many request are made
* It takes *too long* until the user see the page!

Some numbers from Instagram:

* 9.5mb minimized javascript
* 2.5mb after gzip
