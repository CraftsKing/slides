## Motivation

* Users (hopefully) **come back** to your app after the initial visit
* They should **not** be forced to **redownload** assets they already downloaded
  * Even if a **partial update** has been published inbetween
* Users **on slow connections** may get **frustrated**
  * Waiting longer may be expected with slow connections
  * But not when the user opens the app the second time...
* Server **bandwidth is limited/expensive**
* User **bandwidth is limited/expensive** (i. e. mobile connections)
