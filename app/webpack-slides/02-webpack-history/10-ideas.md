## Idea

### Background

* I tried Google's *GWT* (Google Web Toolkit: Java -> JavaScript)
  * It has an awsome feature called **Code Splitting**.
  * But I don't want to write my web app in <b>Java</b>.
* I like **optimization** (I tend to overoptimization).

### So...

* I wanted a **module bundler**.
* It should support **on demand loading** of part of the web app.
* It should have many **optimization** build in.
