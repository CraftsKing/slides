## 2012

* I tried **adding** Code Splitting **to webmake** to make a PR.
  * But it resulted in a **complete reimplementation**.
  * Original author (@medikoo) asked me to change the name: web**pack**
  * He also gave some awesome feedback.
* **webpack** was a separate project since then.
* Some early adopters gave feedback
  * node.js compatibility
  * Extendability
  * Error messages
  * etc.
